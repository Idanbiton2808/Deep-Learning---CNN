# Deep-Learning---CNN
In this project, i Build and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.

--Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
--The architecture of a custom CNN with multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and fully connected layers.
--The training process, including loss calculation, backpropagation, and optimization using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
--Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's performance on test data.
